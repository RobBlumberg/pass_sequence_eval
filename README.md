# Quantifying the quality of pass sequences using expected goals

This repo contains a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/RobBlumberg/pass_sequence_eval/blob/master/src/pass_sequence_eval.ipynb) where I cluster passes, and then rate pass sequences using expected goals and LSTM. Data used is from [Statsbomb open data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data), and I used my own package, [sbdataextraction](https://github.com/RobBlumberg/sbdataextraction), to get the data into python.
